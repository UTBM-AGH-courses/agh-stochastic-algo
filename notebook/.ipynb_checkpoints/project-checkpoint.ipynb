    "In a world where everything move fast, airline companies have to adapt their airplane allocation in order to fit as best as they can the passanger demand. To reach that goal, one of the possible method is using a stochastic approach. In fact, many variables must be digest to find one the best possible airplane distribution. A stochastic approach is well fitted for our case because it's allow to search one possible solution among a large set of possible one by trying a lot of airplanes distribution solutions.\n",

    "In our proble, an airline company wishes to allocate airplanes of various types among its route to satisfy an uncertain passenger demand, in such a way as to minimize operating costs plus the lost revenue from passengers turned away.\n",
