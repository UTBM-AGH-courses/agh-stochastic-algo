X X X X X ==> the generation

1)X X => X ==> The generation
New generation = X X X X X X
==> mu union lambda
Change to mu+lambda (size parentale pop + size of pop of child)
Child put in an other set (of size lambda)
Then pick the best in lambda set
If stagnation ==> change way of selection





2) X X => X ==> X X X X X
The elitist method
New generation = X X X X X
After stagnation = macro mutation

origin mutation < 0.1
Macro mut = increase a lot the diversity.
Impl = change the mutation by increase it (close to 0.5 - 0.3)
nb of step to use this new value = fixed or find individual with objective better than the previous one (0.8)
restart ==> neightboorwood of the "better" solution

feedback ==> memorise the min of the set and recognise where is the stagnation
Restart from this point and be less elitist

Compare results with Benjamin (2 types) :
 - Final budget (give the same to both = cost of computation). Return min best obj + std
 - Final result (reach the same result) = define stopping condition. Return the min number of steps + std
